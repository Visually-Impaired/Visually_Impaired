# Dhrishti : Project for Visually Impaired

Wikipedia is an avenue for users to gain knowledge about a variety of things and acts as a source for reliable information on almost any topic we wish to know about. But this information should be available to everyone, including the visually impaired. 

Our project Dhrishti attempts to bridge this gap by helping those with visual impairment access this information in a manner which is convenient to them. Our project encompasses a chrome extension which allows the user to input their form of disability, be it colour blindness, hypermetropia or incomplete visibility. 

Dhrishti allows users with colour blindness to choose their respective category of colour blindness and instantly makes respective changes to the webpage in terms of colour contrast and visibility to make it better accessible for the user. 

Along with that, we also provide a feature for users to be able zoom into a particular part of the webpage without increasing the size of the entire webpage, allowing them to clearly read the part they may be hovering over without distorting their view of the entire page. 

Not only that, we also provide the feature of simply creating a summary of the entire web page and displaying it on a separate tab, where the summary is conveyed to the user through speech synthesis allowing them to access this information in a compact manner without having the hassle of reading the entire text, by simply being able to hear it. The user will have the ability to play, pause, restart and even change the dictation speed according to their convenience. 

But to integrate the entire process for the user in a seamless manner, the extension also provides an easy access button to the main Wikipedia page where the user can enter their topic of choice simply by speaking it, which gets converted to text in the search box for the user to be taken to the respective webpage. The webpage also includes a text box for the user to switch to a different wikipedia page of any topic and a similar methodology of searching through voice recognition is included via the extension. 

The tech stack used in the making of this project includes -
